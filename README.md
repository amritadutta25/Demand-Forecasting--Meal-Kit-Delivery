# Demand-Forecasting--Meal-Kit-Delivery

As part of the Business Analytics course at Columbia University, my team and I worked on building a Demand Forecating model for Meal Kit delivery services. 

Using weekly demand and sales data for past three years, we have build a model that predicts the demand of goods for the following week. Since most meal kit delivery services deal with perishable items, it is important to predict the demand accurately in order to prevent monetary loss and food wastage.
